      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <p>
        A time I was blocked on a simple problem this week was doing the 6th Kata exercise. Maybe it wasn’t the simplest of problems, but my issue was simple. Question 1.1; use a for loop to add a property called win to every element in athleteArray. Win should be a function expression with no parameters that console logs: "{name} won the {sport} event!" The problem was I didn’t read the question properly. I spent a while making my solution and console logging the output and couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t passing. I read the question aloud to myself a few times and realised that the question was telling me the order to do things in. I had done the steps incorrectly. From there it was simple enough to understand why I was failing and what I had to do. 
      </p>

        I’m not sure I’ve ever elegantly solved a problem yet, but the most satisfying problem for me was, again, Kata 6 question 2.1, create an unjumble function. It took a simple google and there was an article explaining exactly what I needed. It broke down the steps and showed how to combine everything into one seamless line of code “return s.split('').reverse().join('').” That was the most elegant coding solution I’ve done and will probably stick with me because of how satisfying it was to solve a problem with such a small amount of code.

        My problem solving ability is something I need to work on. I have identified my weakness as interpreting questions properly, so therefore it limits my ability to write pseudocode. I can see pseudocode as being incredibly useful, and a skill I wish to practise. The rubber duck method is something I’d never heard of until this course, and I think I did a light version of it with  my above example when I spoke aloud the question. Console logging is a tool that I started using more frequently once I discovered how to do it in VS Code by typing node in the terminal. I feel like I’m very confident with googling solutions, but maybe too reliant on this which could be hindering my learning? My technique for every problem is to google the question before I do anything as it gives me an idea of where to start.
      </p>

        I don’t believe I’ve been reluctant to ask for help so far, as I find when I am confronted with a problem, I get fixated on solving it. It’s been interesting that my peers have been asking similar questions I have on discord, so that’s a useful resource. As we go forward into parts of the course where content and code becomes more original, I am sure I’ll be asking for plenty of help and guidance.
