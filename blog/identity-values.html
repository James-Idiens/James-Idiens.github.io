      <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
      <p>When I quit my last job, as a manager part of the process was an exit interview. It was written feedback on a huge range of questions and topics. Now, without going into too much detail there were a lot of things I wanted to give feedback on that I knew other managers and staff were too afraid to speak up about. Everybody gave a good exit interview because they knew saying anything negative could be burning bridges (not how it should be, but it was). I debated whether or not to be honest and constructively say my feedback or do what everyone else did. It was very much a decision of my professional career vs my own values. It wasn’t easy but I decided to be honest and share my thoughts on certain topics I thought could be changed/improved. I could tell it was not taken well, but I felt better knowing I hadn’t compromised myself. It is a situation I have no regrets in, and being out of the environment for a while gives me better perspective on the whole situation.</p>

      <h4>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
      <p>My family has placed a high importance on education so I’ve always been encouraged to pursue studies. My dad left school at 15, and my mum never completed her degree so both of them have reason to want their children to have formal education. My sister is a doctor and my friends are all doing well in their respective fields, so I feel as though there is an expectation for me to also be successful in the path I take. I place high importance on family and friendships and I value loyalty above all else. 
        I saw a career advisor last year and part of that included looking at my values. I did a career intelligence test and my three things I value in life are; freedom, authenticity and connection. Freedom comes in the form of both professional and personal freedom. I want a career where I have complete autonomy. Authenticity comes in the form of honesty and loyalty. Connection is getting to know new people and at work it is about working with like minded people.

      <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
      <p>I did the CliftonStrengths test and came out with my signature themes. They are as follows
        Deliberative - I am vigilant and thoughtful which can be misconstrued as being aloof and reserved. I take a more methodical approach to tasks and approach with caution.
        Intellection - I  like thinking and using my brain. This course is all about trying to teach my brain  something completely foreign and it’s exciting to learn something I never thought I would be able to do.
        Harmony - I like to minimise conflict and find common ground. This will be a strength put to the test in group projects and assignments.
        Adaptability - I can respond willingly to demands of the moment. I think this will be something of high importance in programming and thinking like a programmer.

      <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
      <p>First year of university and first group project. I got put with strangers and didn’t know anyone. The group was probably one of the worst I was part of because we were all inexperienced. There were five of us and it didn’t flow smoothly. Sometimes one person would drop out of contact for days or someone wouldn’t show up to the meetings. Being young, I was too insecure to take charge of the group, and didn’t realise that everyone else was waiting for someone else to take the lead. I think the problem was we were all too diplomatic and inoffensive so nobody spoke up and set clearly defined tasks. Groups do need a leader (whether official or unofficial) to guide the work and conversations.
