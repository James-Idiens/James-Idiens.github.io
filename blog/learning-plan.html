        <h5>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
        <p>I want to achieve financial freedom and I see software development as an incredibly valuable skill to achieve that. I want a job that doesn’t confine me to one spot, and gives me the ability to work remotely. I don’t think of careers in terms of jobs, rather I think about what I want from a job and look for roles that fulfil that. Flexibility and compensation are the two keys for me. I see my immediate career pathway as getting a job in this field to develop my skills and gain work experience. I don’t believe I would forever stay purely a software developer, as if I continue being an employee, I would like to progress through management and into higher levels of responsibility.  The short term goal is to be employed in the industry within three months of graduating. My ultimate long term goal, however, is to start a business. A business could be freelancing,  creating software, selling a product - all things that will benefit from my knowledge gained from this course.</p>

        <h5>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h5>
        <p>I believe my main strength lies in my desire to learn. I have been starved of learning for the last several years in a job where I felt I was not being mentally stimulated. I greatly enjoy discovering new things and acquiring new knowledge. My other strength is my motivation. I have strong motivation to succeed on this course. I quit my job without a plan and have gambled everything on coming to Dev Academy. The more effort I put into this course the more likelihood I have of being employed.
          <p>The main limitations would be self belief and comparing myself to others on the course. This course does intimidate me because coding was never something I believed I could do. I remember being fed the lie that you need to be good at maths to do programming. Getting over that mental barrier of believing that I will struggle with the content is something I need to work on. Comparison is something everyone is guilty of. I don’t like the feeling when other people understand something and I don’t, so the temptation is to pretend I understand it too. I know this is something that was touched on by the course facilitators, so this course I will put my ego to one side, and always be honest and ask for help when I need it. I’m here to succeed.

        <h5>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        <p>Being more comfortable in group situations. I don’t particularly enjoy group projects and work (probably due to university) .</p>

        <h5>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h5>
          Something I do like is the short nature of this course, meaning that the end is in sight. This light at the end of the tunnel will give me the resilience needed to work productively with others involved in the course.
          <p>I’m not quite sure what I’m in for with the bootcamp but, so far for the foundations, my plan is to put aside 40 hours for the week and treat this as my full time job. I found during university, I worked at my best when I had a mass of assignments with the same deadline. My strategy is to do as much as possible early on to allow myself a buffer before the deadline. I like to give myself a personal deadline and sit down and get a task/assignment done. </p>
        <p>If things are building up I will be in contact with my facilitators as I know that’s what they are there for. In the event I do start to crumble under the pressure and workload then reaching out to keep staff in the loop is the most sensible option. Hopefully from there we can discuss ways or strategies to cope. I think from a personal standpoint though, I’m going to make a concerted effort to get away from my computer screen and go outside, and interact with my friends and family. Doing a remote course can be all consuming, and quite isolating, so it’s important to give yourself some perspective and step out into reality. </p>

        <h5>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
        <p>I expect them to be there to assist me with any issues I have. With how intense this course is, I want strong support.</p>

        <h5>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h5>
        <p>In terms of scheduling commitments I do not have any that I am aware of. The course is my first and foremost priority and so I try to schedule anything around the course. Exceptions will be unforeseen events.</p>
