       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is James and I’m from Christchurch. I’m attending Dev Academy as I’ve decided to do a career change. I attended university and did a Bcom, and probably like many people, I graduated university still not knowing what I really wanted to do. In the years since finishing uni, I was working various management roles in supermarkets. It came to a point at the end of last year where I knew what I was doing wasn’t what I wanted, so I quit my job without a plan B. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realised what is most important to me is work life balance. I noticed my friends in tech had that, and they encouraged me to make the switch. Having already done a degree though, I did not want to go back and study for years. After speaking to a few people in the industry I heard a personal testimony about Dev Academy, and now here I am!
