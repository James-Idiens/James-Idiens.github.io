      <h4>What is EQ?</h4>
      <p>Have you ever met someone who seems to excel in relationships and social situations? You may have met people who demonstrate EQ. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand and manage one’s emotions, and the emotions of others. This is something easier said than done. Emotional intelligence is all about self  self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, motivation, and social skills. </p>

      <h4>EQ vs IQ</h4>
      <p>IQ is cognitive ability. Think logical, rational thinking and problem solving. Perhaps something that seems synonymous with programmers? EQ is not as measurable as IQ, as it focuses on the soft skills discussed above. Which is more important than the other? Well, you could argue EQ.</p>

      <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
      <p>EQ can affect every area of life, from relationships, career success, and overall well-being. Individuals with high EQ are more likely to have strong social skills, build positive relationships, and effectively communicate their thoughts and feelings. They are also better equipped to handle stress, manage conflict, and regulate their own emotions. All recipes for success in their personal and professional lives. The general consensus online is that EQ plays a far more important role in career success than IQ. You may be the smartest person in the room, but as the saying goes: “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”</p>
