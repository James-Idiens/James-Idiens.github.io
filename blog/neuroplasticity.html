      <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Once thought to be a fixed organ after adolescence, new research proves that the brain is a highly malleable and active learning machine across a person's lifetime. Neuroplasticity involves the strengthening or weakening of existing connections between neurons or the creation of new connections to adapt to new situations. This concept of neuroplasticity allows people to learn new skills and recover from brain damage. Learning new skills or engaging in mentally stimulating activities can stimulate the growth of new neurons and connections in the brain. Practice or repetition, strengthens those neural pathways. This is why practising a new skill is so important. Other factors that influence neuroplasticity are; exercise, diet, sleep and even mindfulness. Visualisation has shown to be a powerful tool for engaging the same parts of the brain as physically doing the same thing.

      <p>
        Growth mindset has been pioneered by psychologist Carol Dweck, who says that individuals with a growth mindset tend to embrace challenges, persist in the face of obstacles, and view failure as an opportunity for learning and growth. Those with the opposite, a fixed mindset, will tend to shy away from challenges, give up easily when faced with obstacles, and view failure as a reflection of their inherent limitations. This concept is especially relevant to Dev Academy’s course, because learning to be a job ready programmer in 17 weeks is no easy task. A successful outcome will be determined from mindset and how we, as students, go about tackling the challenges of the course.

        Before enrolling in Dev Academy, I had never given much thought to mindset or let alone heard about neuroplasticity. Upon researching these topics in the course preparation, I had to be honest with myself and realise that I had a fixed mindset. Reading how my brain could adapt and learn a new skill like programming, gave me more belief in my ability to do the course. Because programming is a new skill for me, I have made a goal to practise every single day, which will help my brain learn more effectively. I’ve changed my mindset to understand that the course will be difficult, but it’s about embracing the difficulty and seeing them as opportunities for learning and growth.
