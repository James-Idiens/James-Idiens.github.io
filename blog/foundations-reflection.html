      <h2>Reflecting on Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few things I have learnt about myself and my ego during the core work of foundations. Firstly, it’s hard to talk about yourself. I think this is a cultural thing in NZ where tall poppy syndrome is rife in everyone’s mind. It gets ingrained at an early age to not talk yourself up, or even be positive about your strengths, as that’s seen as arrogance. When writing about myself I found it didn’t come naturally when I knew it would be seen by others. Something else I learnt was that I’m more close minded than I would like to believe. Writing and learning about the growth mindset allowed me to be brutally honest and realise I had a fixed mindset. I reflected upon it and knew in order to succeed in the Dev Academy environment I needed to adopt a growth mindset. Lastly, I’ve learnt despite what I try to convince myself, I still compare myself to others. That’s an ego thing, and a definite work on. There will always be someone better than you at everything, so there’s no point worrying about that.

        Values, empathy and self awareness go far beyond being useful in learning and programming. They affect everything in life and ultimately how you are as a person. Values direct how you behave and empathy determines how well you can integrate with others. In the workplace these are important for building relationships and fitting into a culture. Self awareness has more of an impact on learning than the other two, as often it’s our ego that will get in the way of learning. People naturally do not like to be bad at something, and when we start learning we will be bad at said skill. Self awareness lets you be honest about limitations and improvements

        The most challenging part of core was writing all the blogs. Sometimes it takes longer than expected to write even a few paragraphs on these subjects as they require research and quite a bit of self reflection. I understand why Dev Academy focuses so much on core work as it’s a quite neglected skill in a lot of teaching institutions - not just in tech. The reason I chose Dev Academy over anywhere else, is because the priority of the course is getting us jobs. I’ve seen it firsthand in workplaces how those with solid core skills surpass others with superior technical skills. We’ve all seen and heard the stereotype of tech workers having poor social skills, and unfortunately I’ve heard from some of my friends in tech that the stereotype exists. With all that into consideration, I don’t think learning core is a waste of time. Focusing purely on programming for a course this intense would be a recipe for burnout.
